# pc_simulator_win_codeblocks
PC simulator project for LittlevGL embedded GUI Library for Windows in Codeblocks

This requires the MinGW version of **CodeBlocks 20.03 or newer** to be installed.

## How to use this:

###  Tutorial for Windows
1) Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
2) Download [CodeBlocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/) in latest version. It is *strongly* recommended to use the version which includes MinGW, as otherwise you will have to install and configure it separately, and there have been issues reported with missing header files when a standalone MinGW installation is used.
3) Clone this repository. 
- Open **Command prompt (Win key + R -> cmd -> Enter)** or **PowerShell (Win key + R -> powershell -> Enter)** or **Git bash** (if you want different folder than _C:/Users/username_ you have to navigate to it) and type: `git clone https://github.com/lvgl/lv_sim_codeblocks_win.git`
4) Open **CodeBlocks** and select **Open an existing project**. Navigate to the **lv_sim_codeblocks_win** folder and select **lvgl.cbp**. 
5) Click on **Build and Run** or press **F9**. 
6) If everything goes well, you should see your simulator running.
